I am the CoFounder at [Karis](https://karis.im/), where I spearhead the algorithm team in advancing the core capabilities of General Agents. Previously, I was a Researcher at [MetaGPT (DeepWisdom)](https://www.deepwisdom.ai/), and initiated [OpenManus](https://github.com/FoundationAgents/OpenManus) with the team. My research focuses on LLM-based Agents, particularly Agent Self-Evolution and Foundation Agents.

I am also the Research Lead at [Agent Universe](https://github.com/Agent-Universe), leading team research on AI content reformulation and redistribution.

Besides my work in AI, I am an [Independent Musician](https://y.qq.com/n/ryqq/singer/003uqHad2JLREo) on Tencent Music, creating instrumental music, Traditional Chinese style (Gufeng), and Electronic music, with over 2 million plays and 1k+ followers.
