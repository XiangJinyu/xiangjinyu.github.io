I am the CoFounder at [Amplift](https://www.amplift.ai/), where I spearhead the algorithm team in advancing the core capabilities of General Agents. Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree in Applied Physics from Southwest Jiaotong University. My research interest primarily focuses on LLM Based Agents, with particular emphasis on Agent Self-Evolving and Foundation Agents.

I am also the Research Lead at [Agent Universe](https://github.com/Agent-Universe), leading team research on AI content reformulation and redistribution. Before that, I worked as a Researcher at [DeepWisdom](https://www.deepwisdom.ai/) on Agent Self-Optimization and Foundation Agent research.

Besides my work in AI, I am an [Independent Musician](https://y.qq.com/n/ryqq/singer/003uqHad2JLREo) on Tencent Music, creating instrumental music, Traditional Chinese style (Gufeng), and Electronic music, with over 2 million plays and 1k+ followers.
